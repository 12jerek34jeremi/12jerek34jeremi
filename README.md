Hi, I'm Jędrzej Chmiel. I study Computer Science at the Warsaw University of Technology at WEiTI (Faculty of Electronics and Information Technology). In June (2025) I will finish my bachelor's degree. You can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/jedrzej-chmiel-481a8423b) .


Some of my projects:
- [***LSINF***](https://www.notion.so/LSINF-d0f47277b46b4992a5c9f0bd0d377170?pvs=4) ‑ Researching
Latent Space of Normalising Flow Architecture based on a model that generates images. Normalizing
Flow is an architecture used mainly to generate data from random noise, like GANs or VAEs. In this
project, I study if, apart from generating good‑quality images from random noise, you can use NFs
for classification, generating movies, and data augmentation. I am doing this project as part of my
bachelor's thesis. The project is still in progress. An [interesting
issue](https://github.com/VincentStimper/normalizing-flows/issues/67) was created regarding the
project.
- [Distance Calculator](https://github.com/12jerek34jeremi/distance_calculator) - A web application for calculating the distance between two geographic points. (Vue JS + PHP)
- [LTL Conformance Checking](https://github.com/12jerek34jeremi/confermence) ‑ A web application for
Customizable Linear Temporal Logic Checking.
- [Grab a Car](https://github.com/12jerek34jeremi/grabacar) ‑ A mobile application (flutter) for
short‑term car rental.
